# Design Patterns

The Design Patterns cataloged by [Erich Gamma](https://github.com/egamma), [Richard Helm](https://www.bcg.com/pt-br/about/people/experts/richard-helm), [Ralph Johnson](https://github.com/smalltalker55) and [John Vlissides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vlissides) in the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com.br/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8/ref=asc_df_B000SEIBB8/?tag=googleshopp00-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=379725882390&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16987175432751364423&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1001773&hvtargid=pla-406130702825&psc=1)
are in my opinion the most important patterns to solve problems at the class-level in an application. In this repo, I implemented from the scratch each one of the patterns. I think this way becomes easy to understand and solidify the knowledge. 

I covered the following topics :

## Creational

-[Abstract Factory](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/creational/abstractFactory)
-[Factory Method](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/creational/factory)

## Structural

-[Adapter](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/adapter)
-[Bridge](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/bridge)
-[Decorator](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/decorator)
-[Composite](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/composite)
-[Proxy](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/proxy)
-[Flyweight](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/flightweight)
-[Facade](https://github.com/ads1986/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/facade)
